# XAI_boron_LA

## Project Description
This project focuses on Explainable AI (XAI) techniques applied to the study and design of Boron Lewis acids. It is associated to the article : Constructing and explaining machine learning models for chemistry: example of the exploration and design of boron derivatives with targeted Lewis acidity

## Usage

Scripts containing main codes to reproduce results and optimized ML models can be found in the ####scripts folder. Several notebooks can be run independently to reproduce figures of the publication.
All the material can be further used to investigate the structure-property link and molecular design for another chemical problem including for example other chemical properties or reaction selectivities or yields of chemical reactions.
